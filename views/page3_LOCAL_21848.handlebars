<h3>Point of View</h3>

<p>
    Based off the user needs you wrote down in the previous step, write a 1-2 sentence point of view. A point of view describes a core problem in relation to the activity you chose.

<p class="hint">
    (The point of view should address a deep user need and take a high-level design strategy without offering any concrete solution.)
