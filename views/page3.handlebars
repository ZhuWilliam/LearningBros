<h3>User Base</h3>
<br>
<p>
Based off the user needs you wrote down in the last step, write a 1-2
sentence point of view that describes a core problem in relation to the
activity you chose.
</p>
<p><i>The point of view should address a deep user need and take a high-level
    design strategy without offering any concrete solutions.</i></p>
