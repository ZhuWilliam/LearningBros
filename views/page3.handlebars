<h3>Step 3: Point of View <button onclick="showHint()" class="btn-hint">?</button></h3>

<div id="hidden-info">
    <p>
        A point of view is a general statement about the problem.
        <br>
        The point of view should address a deep user need and take a high-level
        design strategy without offering any concrete solutions.
    </p>
</div>

<p>
    Based off the user needs you wrote down in the last step, write a 1-2
    sentence point of view that describes a core problem in relation to the
    activity you chose.
